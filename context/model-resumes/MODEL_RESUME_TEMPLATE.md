- Corpus size this rebuild: `<N completion reviews>`
- Date range covered: `<earliest>` – `<latest>`
- Freshness target: `<rebuild due after X reviews or Y days>`

## Strengths

- **Effort threshold where it degrades:** `<value + unit>`
- Failure modes: `<hallucination, scope creep, lost context, ...>`

## Empirical Metrics

| Dimension | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| Token efficiency | `<tokens per unit of work>` |
| Speed | `<observed throughput>` |
| Estimate accuracy | `<how often estimates were right at given effort/complexity>` |
| Error patterns | `<recurring mistakes>` |

## Routing Guidance
